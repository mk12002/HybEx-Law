```python
# Create training script
from src.nlp_pipeline.stage1_classifier import EntityPresenceClassifier
from data.sample_data import SAMPLE_QUERIES

# Extract training data from samples
classifier = EntityPresenceClassifier()
classifier.train(training_texts, training_labels)
classifier.save_model('models/stage1_classifier.pkl')
```
