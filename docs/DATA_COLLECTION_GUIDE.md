## üîß Data Expansion Strategies

### 1. Template-Based Generation

**Approach**: Use linguistic templates to create variations of existing queries.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Run the data expansion script
python expand_data.py
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Scalable and cost-effective
- ‚úÖ Maintains legal accuracy
- ‚úÖ Creates linguistic diversity
- ‚úÖ Privacy-safe

### 2. Paraphrasing & Variation

**Techniques**:
- **Income Expression Variations**: Multiple ways to express same income
- **Case Description Variations**: Different phrasings for same legal issue
- **Social Category Variations**: Various ways to express identity
- **Help-Seeking Variations**: Different ways to request legal aid

**Example Variations**:
```
Original: "I earn 15000 rupees per month"
Variations:
- "My monthly income is 15000"
- "I make 15000 each month"
- "My salary is 15000 per month"
- "I get 15000 rupees monthly"
```

### 3. Synthetic Data Generation

**Using the Built-in Generator**:
```python
from src.data_generation.legal_data_generator import LegalDataGenerator

generator = LegalDataGenerator()
dataset = generator.generate_dataset(size=1000)
generator.save_dataset(dataset, "data/synthetic_legal_queries.json")
```

**Features**:
- Realistic legal scenarios
- Balanced case type distribution
- Proper income and social category representation
- Legal accuracy maintained

### 4. Expert Validation

**Process**:
1. **Legal Expert Review**: Have practicing lawyers validate scenarios
2. **Law Student Projects**: Engage law schools for data creation
3. **Legal Aid Worker Input**: Get feedback from frontline workers
4. **Community Validation**: Test with actual legal aid seekers

## üîí Privacy & Ethics Guidelines

### Data Protection Measures

#### Personal Information Anonymization:
- ‚ùå Remove names, addresses, phone numbers
- ‚ùå Remove identification numbers (PAN, Aadhaar, etc.)
- ‚ùå Remove specific location details
- ‚úÖ Use placeholder values: [NAME], [LOCATION], [PHONE]

#### Example Anonymization:
```
Original: "John Doe from Sector 15 Gurgaon called 9876543210"
Anonymized: "[NAME] from [LOCATION] called [PHONE]"
```

### Legal Compliance

#### Required Permissions:
- ‚úÖ Data collection agreements with source organizations
- ‚úÖ Ethical review board approval for research use
- ‚úÖ Compliance with Indian data protection laws
- ‚úÖ Informed consent where applicable

#### Ethical Guidelines:
- ‚úÖ Respect confidentiality of legal cases
- ‚úÖ Avoid bias against protected groups
- ‚úÖ Ensure fair representation across demographics
- ‚úÖ Consider impact on vulnerable populations

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Implementation

### Step 1: Setup Data Collection Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

# Create data directories
mkdir -p data/raw data/processed data/annotations
```

### Step 2: Expand Current Dataset

```bash
# Run data expansion
python expand_data.py

# This will create:
# - data/processed/expanded_legal_data.json
# - data/processed/expanded_legal_data_train.json
# - data/processed/expanded_legal_data_validation.json
# - data/processed/expanded_legal_data_test.json
```

### Step 3: Generate Synthetic Data

```python
# Generate large synthetic dataset
from src.data_generation.legal_data_generator import LegalDataGenerator

generator = LegalDataGenerator()
large_dataset = generator.generate_dataset(size=2000)

# Save with proper splits
generator.save_dataset(large_dataset, "data/synthetic_large_dataset.json")
```

### Step 4: Collect Real Data (with permissions)

```python
# Use the legal document scraper (for public sources only)
from src.data_collection.legal_scraper import LegalDocumentScraper

scraper = LegalDocumentScraper()
# Only use for publicly available documents with proper permissions
```

## üìû Getting Started

1. **Immediate Action**: Run `python expand_data.py` to expand current dataset
2. **Week 1**: Set up partnerships with local legal aid organizations  
3. **Week 2**: Implement web scraping for public legal databases
4. **Week 3**: Begin expert validation process
5. **Month 1**: Deploy synthetic data generation at scale
6. **Month 2**: Integrate real-world case studies (anonymized)

Remember: Quality over quantity! Better to have 500 perfectly annotated, legally accurate queries than 5,000 poor-quality examples.
